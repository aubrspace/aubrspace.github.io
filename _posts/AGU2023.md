Here is a video showing Earth's magnetopause identified in a Space Weather Modeling Framework simulation. The contour on the boundary is total energy flux, where magenta represents energy entering the magnetosphere while gold indicated energy escaping the magnetosphere. During this period in the simulated storm of February 2014 a large pressure pulse in the solar wind rapidly compresses the magnetopause boundary.

This animated schematic shows the total energy flux integrated over topological boundaries of Earth's magnetosphere for another simulated storm which occured in February 2022. The top panel shows the solar wind IMF conditions used as inputs to the simulation. These values were propagated from observations made by satellites located at L1. As the Z component of the IMF (blue curve) changes sign, notice the sharp increase in energy flux magnitudes indicated by the vector lengths as well as the rapid change in flux direction across the internal interfaces. This IMF turning as it is called marks the end of the main phase of this geomagnetic storm.

Extending this further, we compare the energy flux values with the dayside/nightside reconnection rates. The animation below shows the magnetopause contoured by magnetic topology (top left), the energy flux at at the magnetopause (top right), the closed field line magnetosphere contoured by magnetic mapping (bottom left: dayside= white, nightside= purple), and the open closed field line boundary of the northern hemisphere contoured by magnetic flux transport (bottom right: blue=open flux injection, red= open flux escape).

For this test case, the input solar wind density, velocity, and temperature are held constant and the IMF is updated every 2 hours. For some intervals the internal dynamics of the magnetosphere are relatively quiet, but for others like the case shown here, there is clear nightside reconnection activity which actually affects the dayside reconnection rate and therefore the solar wind - magnetosphere coupling.
