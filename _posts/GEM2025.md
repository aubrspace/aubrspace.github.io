Here is a video showing high energy electron fluxes projected to the equatorial plane for a simulation of the Gannon storm of May 10, 2024 using the Radiation Belt Environment model (RBE) combined with the SWMF in Geospace configuration.

The right panel shows pitch angle anisotropy, clearly showing the drift shell splitting effect due to the compressed (stretched) field on the dayside (nightside).
