Welcome! This animated schematic shows the total energy flux integrated over topological boundaries of Earth's magnetosphere for simulated storm which occured in February 2022. The top panel shows the solar wind IMF conditions used propagated from satellites located at L1. Notice the sharp increase in energy flux magnitudes indicated by the vector lengths as well as the rapid change in flux direction across the internal interfaces.
