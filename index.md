Welcome! This animated schematic shows the total energy flux integrated over topological boundaries of Earth's magnetosphere for a simulated storm which occured in February 2022. The top panel shows the solar wind IMF conditions used as inputs to the simulation. These values were propagated from observations made by satellites located at L1. As the Z component of the IMF (blue curve) changes sign, notice the sharp increase in energy flux magnitudes indicated by the vector lengths as well as the rapid change in flux direction across the internal interfaces. This IMF turning as it is called marks the end of the main phase of this geomagnetic storm.
